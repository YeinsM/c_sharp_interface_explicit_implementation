# "C# Interfaces" Explicit Implementation
This repository contains sample code for the "C# Interfaces".

# Running the Sample
The code sample can be followed using Visual Studio (Windows) or Visual Studio Code (Windows, Linux, macOS).

.NET 5.0 - development tool options

Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition)
Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition)
Visual Studio Code

When using Visual Studio, open the solution file (.sln) that is included in each sample folder. The solution is set up to automatically start the web application as well as the required web service, so no special action should be required.

Running the Application
To run a project, click F5 or use "Start debugging" from the toolbar or Debug menu.

Your default browser will automatically open to http://localhost:5000 (the location of the web application). When you are done, close the browser window.

When using Visual Studio Code.

Running the Application
To run the console application (OddNumbers), use the following steps:

Open a terminal folder OddNumbers.
Type "dotnet run". (This will rebuild the project if necessary.)
The application should start and show the following info:
~~~
Odd Numbers:
1
3
5

9
11

15
17
19

You can change the count numbers to print in program class.

To run the application, open a browser to http://localhost:5000.

When you are done, you can stop the web server by going back to the terminal window and pressing "Ctrl+C".

Alternately, you can run the web application from within Visual Studio Code by using the integrated debugger. For more information, see Visual Studio Code - Debugging.
